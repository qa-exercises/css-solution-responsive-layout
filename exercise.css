ðŸ’ª Exercise: Use CSS media queries to create a responsive layout

Before you attempt the exercise, experiment with the CSS rule for the "main" tag below.

Change the value of "flex-direction" to "column" instead of "row" - notice that the page changes from using a horizontal layout to a vertical layout, suitable for smaller screens such as those found on mobile devices.

ðŸŽ¯ Your task:
- Make this page responsive.
  - On smaller screens (up to 500px wide), a vertical layout should be displayed.
  - On larger screens, a horizontal layout should be displayed.

ðŸ’¡ Tip:
- Use the example as a reference if you can't remember how to write a media query for screen size.
